# COICOP Classification

Project to classify products according to COICOP/ECOICOP taxonomy.

We leverage a set of LLM providers which offer a generous free tier for their APIs. In order to use the same providers, insert your API keys in the `example.env` file and rename it as `.env`.

## Build the classification grid
Run the notebook `ecoicop_classification_grid.ipynb` to build a classification grid for ECOICOP v1 leveraging LLMs.
